# eslint-config-ristretto

### A [Shareable ESLint Config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) based on [AirBnB Style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

This package is a re-implementation of the **eslint-config-airbnb** package, which provides a set of opiniated rules for ESLint to enforce coding style and best practices in TypeScript. This rewrite is meant to provide a more customizable and lightweight version of the original package, while still adhering to the same principles and guidelines set forth by the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
